# ðŸ§  Model Context Protocol (MCP) Guide for Refund Protect Integration

## 1. MCP Summary

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a protocol that allows LLM agents (such as ChatGPT or Claude) to dynamically interact with APIs and tools through a shared context. MCP bridges the gap between natural language interfaces and programmable systems, enabling context-aware execution of code, API calls, and plugin usageâ€”all through structured prompts.

### 3.1 What is a Client Agent?

A **Client Agent** is an AI model or chatbot (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek) configured to interact with external tools or services using the MCP specification. These agents can interpret prompts and execute actions through MCP-enabled tools.

### 3.2 Agents that Support MCP Integration

- **Cursor**
- **Claude (via Cursor)**
- **Windsurf by Codeium**
- **ChatGPT (coming soon)**

### 3.3 ChatGPT Support

Support for **ChatGPT with MCP** is **coming soon**. Once integrated, you will be able to use the same MCP commands within ChatGPT Pro environments, with persistent tool context and streamlined API interaction.
